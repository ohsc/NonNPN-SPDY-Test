# About This Project
As you know CocoaSPDY is based on Secure Transport (Apple's TLS implementation). And Secure Transport doesn't support NPN.
Take a look at https://github.com/twitter/CocoaSPDY#a-note-on-npn

The project that shows how CocoaSPDY works with node-spdy using nonNPN and forcing SPDY mode.
